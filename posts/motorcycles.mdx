"Motorcycles are cool" I have thought ever since I was a kid. I've always been captivated by the way they look, sound and how fast they go.
A few months ago, I was studying for my driver's license exam to finally be able to drive my family car! While I was studying, my dad brought up the idea
that I could also use a Moped (49cc) motorcycle with my B-Grade driver's license, which doesn't let you ride 50cc+ motorcycles.
I wasn't too happy about using a Moped since they're very slow and just aren't that fun, but dad told me that you can actually **upgrade the engine** to a 125cc.
After hearing that, I was definitely convinced to try one, so after I successfully got my driver's license, dad bought a moped that was upgraded from 49cc to 125cc.
I could *technically* ride it since in the registraion, it says that the motorcycle's engine is 49cc.

### The Motorcycle

The motorcycle, Altai F2 Max Euro 50, is pretty cool. It has a comfortable seat and decent mirrors, but it was **super** loud, and its tires were super slipper so we had to get them changes. The brakes are that good, **especially** the rear brake, which might as well not work.

My dad wanted me to work as a courier to pay for the motorcycle, and I agreed.

I'm currently still working until I start university which is in about 2 weeks to gather money to buy a cool Yamaha motorcycle, it's been pretty fun!
