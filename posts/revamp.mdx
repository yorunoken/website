## Hello vro

I'm excited to bring to you: **new changes!**

I've rewritten my personal website from scratch using Next.js, as the old website was looking too bland for me, and I just wanted to get rid of it.
The [much older website](https://old.yorunoken.com) is still availabe to the public if you want to check it out, it was the first website I've ever made
and it's archived on [GitHub](https://github.com/yorunoken/personal-website), also made using Next.js (but hosted on Vercel).

I don't have a lot to write, as this is my first blog post ever, but I've recently gotten into motorcycles (and have gotten my own) so I might write about that, cheers!
